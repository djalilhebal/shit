      <h2>What?</h2>
      Solves Lewis Carroll's word game Doublets (AKA "Word Ladder"):
      Given two words X and Y, find a chain ("ladder") of words that take you from X to Y with only one edit a time.
      Each intermediate word should be a valid/dictionary word.
      
      My algorithm is biased towards words that appear in Nicki Minaj's lyrics (in pink).

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      - Tested on Chrome v70. Performance-wise, it sucks.
      - Uses a wordlist that contains the 50K most common words in English. (This demo actually uses just the first 2K words)
      - Nicki's words were obtained from an incomplete collection of her lyrics (Check <b>wordli$ter.js</b>: It is the script that created the <b>wordli$t.txt</b> file).
      - Uses a <i>breadth-first search</i> algorithm on a "graph of words".
      - Uses <b>Hip</b>, my stupid Array-based <i>heap</i> implementation with only three methods: push, pop, and isEmpty.
      - The Levenshtein distance can be used to make things interesting, but let's just use the <i>Hamming distance</i> to keep it simple ._.
